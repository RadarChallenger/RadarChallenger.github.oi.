      We're in an exciting new era of small satellite technology - one that’s
      making life on Earth better. We all rely on satellites. They connect us,
      keep us safe, help us understand our planet and manage our impact on it,
      and enable us to innovate and explore.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Space is the ultimate high ground. It provides us with a new perspective
        on the challenges facing our planet, and can be the key to helping us
        solve them.
      </li>
      <li>
        We’re enabling companies, students, scientists, researchers, governments
        and entrepreneurs alike to get their ideas to orbit, right now. A solar
        system of possibilities has opened up for people who thought space was
        out of reach, until now.
      </li>
      <li>
        The satellites we build and launch are keeping countries connected and
        borders protected, they're monitoring weather and managing waste,
        they're providing insights on climate change, and helping us manage
        resources for future generations. By unlocking the potential of space,
        we are making a tangible difference to life on Earth.
      </li>
    </ul>
